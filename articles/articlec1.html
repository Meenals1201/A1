           <h3>Resumes are out. Skills, portfolios, and real work are in.</h3>
            
            <p>Discover what's replacing resumes and how developers and recruiters can adapt to this hiring shift.</p>

            <p>Resumes are on life support.</p>

            <p>They're stiff, outdated, and don't say much about who you are or what you can do.</p>

            <p>They're just bullet points on a PDF, often filled with buzzwords and job titles that barely scratch the surface.</p>

            <p>And yet... we still send them. Still obsess over them. Still hope they somehow open doors.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, they're quietly being replaced.</p>

            <p>Today, your GitHub shows more than a line on your resume ever could. 
                Your Stack Overflow activity, portfolio, LinkedIn, blog, that's what really makes you stand out.</p>

            <p>Recruiters spend less time reading resumes. They're Googling you. They're checking if you've 
                shipped something, contributed to something, or written something worth reading.</p>

            <p>Yes, resumes still hang around because some systems (and some people) demand them. But they're just a formality now.</p>

            <p>We're entering a new era of hiring. One where what you do matters more than what you say. 
                So what's replacing the resume? And more importantly, how do you get ahead of this change?</p>

            <p>That's what we're here to figure out.</p>

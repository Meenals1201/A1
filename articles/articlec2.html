         <h3>Why Experienced Programmers Fail Coding Interviews</h3>
            
            <p>When you think of seasoned software developers, you likely picture confident, skilled 
                professionals who can handle complex systems with ease. So why do so many experienced 
                programmers fail coding interviews—especially at top tech companies?</p>

            <p>In this article, we'll explore the common reasons behind this disconnect, provide real-world 
                examples, and offer actionable strategies to help experienced developers improve their technical
                 interview performance.</p>

            <p><b>Mismatch Between Daily Work and Interview Format</b><br>
            One of the biggest challenges experienced developers face is the stark contrast between real-world
             development and whiteboard interviews.</p>

            <p>In their jobs, they work with existing systems, collaborate with teams, use powerful tools, 
                and focus on maintainability and scalability.<br>
            In interviews, they're often asked to solve algorithmic problems in isolation, under time 
            pressure, and without access to their usual tools.</p>

            <p>👉 Solution: Practice interview-style problems regularly on platforms like LeetCode 
                or HackerRank. Focus on algorithms, data structures, and time complexity.</p>

            <p><b>Overlooking Fundamentals</b><br>
            With years of experience, many developers shift focus from algorithms to architecture, 
            scalability, and system design. While this is valuable, it often leads to rusty algorithm 
            and data structure skills, which are essential in interviews.</p>

            <p>👉 Solution: Revisit core CS fundamentals. Brush up on hash tables, trees, recursion, 
                dynamic programming, and sorting algorithms. Even just a few hours a week can make a big difference.</p>

            <p><b>Lack of Interview Practice</b><br>
            Experienced programmers may not have interviewed for years, while junior candidates often spend months 
            prepping. The interview environment itself can be intimidating—coding on a whiteboard or shared screen, 
            explaining your thought process aloud, and being evaluated in real-time.</p>

            <p>👉 Solution: Simulate real interviews with peers or mock interview platforms. Get comfortable 
                talking through your solutions and managing time effectively.</p>

            <p><b>Assumptions Based on Seniority</b><br>
            Some seasoned developers believe their experience should speak for itself. While a strong résumé can 
            \get you in the door, most companies still require passing the same coding assessments as junior or mid-level developers.</p>

            <p>👉 Solution: Adjust your mindset. Treat interviews as a skill to be learned, just like any coding 
                language or framework. Your experience adds value—but it won't replace demonstrating problem-solving skills in real time.</p>

            <p><b>Interview Anxiety and Pressure</b><br>
            Even the most capable developers can struggle with the mental pressure of interviews, especially 
            if they're returning to the job market after years.</p>

            <p>👉 Solution: Build confidence through repetition. Practice under realistic conditions, review 
                failed attempts to identify patterns, and develop a calm, focused approach to technical problems.</p>

            <p><b>Final Thoughts: How to Bridge the Gap</b><br>
            The key to success in coding interviews is recognizing that they're a unique skill set—separate from
             your day-to-day engineering work. Fortunately, this skill can be developed with time, consistency, 
             and the right strategies.</p>

            <p>Focus on fundamentals<br>
            Practice regularly<br>
            Simulate real interviews<br>
            Approach it with humility and curiosity</p>

            <p>By combining your experience with refreshed technical fluency, you'll be well-prepared 
                to crack even the toughest coding interviews.</p>

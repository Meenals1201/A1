            <p>
            ChatGPT can do a lot. It can be used to write essays, summarize meetings and even act as your therapist in a pinch.
            </p>
            <p>
            But if you’re still struggling to get personalized responses that go beyond the bland or overly basic, the problem 
            might not be the AI. It could be your prompt.
            </p>
            <p>
            That’s where the “3-word rule” comes in — a super-simple prompt tweak that can take your chatbot from surface-level 
            answers to something that feels custom, thoughtful and expert-level.
            </p>
            <p>
            What is the 3-word rule?
            </p>
            <p>
            No, the three little words are not <em>“I love you”</em> — but it doesn’t hurt to be polite.
            </p>
            <p>
            The concept is simple: Add a short, three-word directive to your prompt that tells ChatGPT how to respond. 
            These three words can instantly shape the tone, voice and depth of the output. You’re not rewriting your whole question. 
            You’re just giving the AI a lens through which to answer.
            </p>
            <p>
            Here are a few examples that work surprisingly well:
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>“Like a lawyer”</b>— for structured, detailed and logical responses
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>“Be a teacher”</b>— for simplified, clear and educational explanations
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>“Act like Hemingway”</b>— for punchy, minimalist writing with impact
            </p>
            <p>
            It’s kind of like casting the AI in a role, and then you're directing the performance 
            with the specifics in your prompts.
            </p>
            <p>
            Why it works
            </p>
            <p>
            ChatGPT has been trained on a massive variety of writing styles and professional voices. When you give it a short 
            cue — something like <em>“like a professor"</em> — it taps into that persona and shifts its tone accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
            That one tweak can turn a vague summary into something polished, insightful and audience-appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
            The 3-word rule is especially helpful when:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You want a response tailored to a specific audience</li>
                <li>You need a certain tone, like persuasive or technical</li>
                <li>You’re trying to avoid generic, shallow replies</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It’s a lightweight form of prompt engineering that makes a big difference; no jargon or prompt-hacking required.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Need a few starter ideas? These role-based prompt formats work across writing, research, translation, brainstorming 
                and creative tasks — and can drastically improve your results:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Summarize this article like a journalist”</li>
                <li>“Explain dark matter like a physics professor”</li>
                <li>“Give me career advice like a mentor”</li>
                <li>“Translate this email like a professional diplomat”</li>
                <li>“Design a pitch deck like a Silicon Valley founder”</li>
                <li>“Review this document like a detail-oriented lawyer”</li>
                <li>“Brainstorm ideas like a Gen Z influencer”</li>
                <li>“Ask me questions like a therapist would”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can swap in almost any role, tone, or perspective that fits your goal — CEO, coach, UX designer, teenager, 
                therapist, stand-up comic, even your future self
